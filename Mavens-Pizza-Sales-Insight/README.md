## Background
For the Maven Pizza Challenge, youâ€™ll be playing the role of a BI Consultant hired by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey. You've been hired to help the restaurant use data to improve operations, and just received the following note:

Welcome aboard, we're glad you're here to help!

Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. We've been collecting transactional data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. Hoping you can analyze the data and put together a report to help us find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.

Thanks in advance,

Mario Maven (Manager, Plato's Pizza)

## Recommendations
Having conducted a thorough analysis of the data, I've identified some valuable insights that have the potential to enhance the business. I would like to propose the following recommendations to the business owners.

* Store credit or points can be applied as discounts when purchasing pizzas. Additionally, by occasionally multiplying these points on random days, sales may experience an uplift.
* To enhance Sunday revenue, think about reducing working hours to support employee well-being while also driving pizza sales through limited-time B1G1 flash sales.
* Let customers design custom pizzas with up to 5 toppings. The best ones chosen by the top chef can be added to the menu, and the customer who created it can name the pizza, allowing for regular menu updates based on customer choices.
* October has the lowest revenue, likely due to its seasonal nature, with Halloween as a key factor. To leverage this, think about introducing Halloween-themed pizzas for the whole month or the week leading up to the event. If successful, this approach could extend to incorporating themed pizzas for other festivals too.
* At the close of the year, gather feedback from customers to identify areas for improvement in the restaurant.
* Due to the lower demand for XL and XXL-sized pizzas, consider introducing a half-and-half pizza option, allowing customers to enjoy two different pizza varieties on a single pie.
